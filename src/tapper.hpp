/**
    A component that orchestrates listener, layouter and emitter to do the work.

    The tapper looks at keyboard events (provided by a listener) detects taps, if an assigned key
    is tapped, tapper executes corresponding series of actions â€” activates keyboard layouts (with
    help from a layouter) and/or emulates keystrokes (with help from an emitter).

    A layouter may notify the tapper when the user session becomes active or inactive (currently
    only the GNOME layouter can do this). If the user session is inactive, the tapper continues to
    detect taps, but will not execute corresponding actions as not to affect another user session.
    Detecting the inactive user session is important only for the libinput listers, though, since
    the XRecord listener do not receive input events from another session anyway.

    Usage:

    @code
    listener_t listener( ... );
    layouter_t layouter( ... );
    emitter_t  emitter( ... );
    // Listener, layouter, and emitter should be created but not started.
    tapper_t   tapper( listener, layouter, emitter );
    tapper.start( ... );    // tapper starts emitter, layouter and listener.
    ...
    tapper.stop();
    @endcode
