/** @file
    Privilege manager interface.

    Stuff is a bit complicated:

    *   libinput listener requires that process belongs to "input" group (or to "root" user) in
        order to open files in "/dev/input/" directory. Since new files may appear in the directory
        at run time (e. g. if user plugs in an USB keybord), and libinput will open these new
        files, Tapper should keep "input" group as long as libinput listener is in use.

    *   libevdev emitter requires that process belongs to "root" user in order to open
        "/dev/uinput" file. As soon as the file open, "root" user can be dropped permanently.

    *   XRecord listener and Xkb layouter do not require any extra permissions and perfectly works
        from regular user. However, connection to display fails if process belongs to "root" user.

    *   The same for GNOME and KDE layouters: D-Bus connection fails in case of "root" user.

    So, `chown root:input tapper && chmod g+s` is enough for libinput listener, but not enough for
    libevdev emitter â€” "input" group can't write "/dev/uinput". `chown root:root && chmod g+s` is
    enough for libevdev emitter, but is not enough for libinput listener â€” "root" group can't read
    "/dev/input/". `chown root:root && chmod u+s` is enough for both libinput listener and libevdev
    emitter, but breaks X, GNOME and KDE layouters. To satisfy all components, user and group
    should be changed in run time.

    Ok, let's start from `chown root:root && chmod u+s` and drop extra permissions as soon as
    possible:

    1.  At the very beginning: drop all supplementary groups; set effective user to real user,
        set saved user to "root" so Tapper can switch back to "root" user for further management;
        set saved group to "input", set effective group to real group.

    2.  If libinput listener is not used: drop "input" group (set both effective and saved group to
        real group).

    3.  If libevdev emitter is not used: drop "root" user completely (set both effective user and
        saved user to real user).

    4.  If libinput listener used, set effective group to saved group (= "input") temporarily, only
        for open file in "/dev/input".

    5.  If libevdev emitter used, to let it open "/dev/uinput": switch back to "root" user, open
        the file, then drop "root" user completely (set both effective user and saved user to real
        user).

    6.  Use a mutex to make sure GNOME and KDE layouter does not open D-Bus connection when Tapper
        temporary switched back to "root" user (step 4). Of course, the same mutex should be used
        in other steps.

    P. S. Actually, `chown root:root && chmod u+s` is to much. Only two capabilities, `cap_setuid`
    and `cap_setgid` are enough.
