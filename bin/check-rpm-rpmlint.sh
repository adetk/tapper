#   rpmlint 2.2.0 has a number of problems:
#       1.  It is too talkative. It prints version, configuration, etc, so its output is never
#           empty.
#       2.  It is very hard to get rid of `unused-rpmlintrc-filter` error. The same rpmlintrc file
#           could be ok for source rpm but cause `unused-rpmlintrc-filter` error for binary rpm.
