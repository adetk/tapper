# Note: This script is called from "outer" make, and rpmbuild invokes "inner" make.
# It causes problem, because outer make saves some flags (including a list of tests to run) in
# environment variable MAKEFLAGS. Thus, inner make tries to execute the same tests as outer one,
# but it should not, because in spec file I explicitly disabled html and rpm. Clearing MAKEFLAGS
# variable avoids the problem.
