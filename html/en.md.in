Tapper
======

RDF_DESCRIPTION({{ RDF_NAME({{ **Tapper** }}) is a RDF_HEADLINE({{ RDF_KEYWORD({{ keyboard layout
switcher }}) for RDF_KEYWORD({{ X Window System }}) and RDF_KEYWORD({{ Wayland }})[^graphical]}}).
Tapper runs in background, when an assigned key is RDF_KEYWORD({{ tap }},{{ tapped[^tap] }}),
Tapper activates the corresponding RDF_KEYWORD({{ keyboard layout }})[^no-toggle]. Tapper key
feature is using RDF_KEYWORD({{ modifier keys }}) for switching keyboard layouts without losing
modifier‚Äôs functionality[^modifiers]. Tapper works[^works] for RDF_KEYWORD({{ GNOME }}),
RDF_KEYWORD({{ GNOME Classic }}), RDF_KEYWORD({{ Cinnamon }}), RDF_KEYWORD({{ i3 }}),
RDF_KEYWORD({{ KDE }}), RDF_KEYWORD({{ LXDE }}), RDF_KEYWORD({{ LXQt }}), RDF_KEYWORD({{ Mate }}),
RDF_KEYWORD({{ Xfce }}). There are prebult RDF_KEYWORD({{ RPM package }})s for
RDF_OPERATING_SYSTEM({{ Fedora }}), RDF_OPERATING_SYSTEM({{ Mageia }}), RDF_OPERATING_SYSTEM({{
OpenMandriva }}), RDF_OPERATING_SYSTEM({{ openSUSE }}), recent versions of RDF_OPERATING_SYSTEM({{
RHEL }}) and its clones. Source tarball for `configure && make` is also available, it should work
for any RDF_OPERATING_SYSTEM({{ GNU/Linux }}) distro, including (but not limited to)
RDF_OPERATING_SYSTEM({{ Alt }}), RDF_OPERATING_SYSTEM({{ Arch }}), RDF_OPERATING_SYSTEM({{ Debian
}}), RDF_OPERATING_SYSTEM({{ Ubuntu }}) and RDF_OPERATING_SYSTEM({{ Void }})[^void]. Tapper is
RDF_KEYWORD({{ RDF_OFFER({{ RDF_PRICE({{ 0.0 }},{{ free }})RDF_PRICE_CURRENCY({{ USD }},{{ - }})
}}) software }}). }})

[^graphical]:
    Tapper works in graphical desktop session only, in either X Window System or Wayland. Tapper
    does not work in the text console (don‚Äôt confuse [text console] with a [terminal emulator]
    running in graphical session, though).

[text console]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_console
[terminal emulator]:    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator

[^tap]:
    A *tap* means that a *single* key is pressed and *quickly* released, so: (1) no other keys are
    pressed or released at this time, and (2) period between pressing the key and releasing it is
    shorter than keyboard repeat delay (the amount of time you have to hold down a key before it
    starts repeating; usually 0.5 second, but it depends on your desktop settings).

[^no-toggle]:
    The assigned key *always activates the same* layout. Tapper *never toggles* layouts, there is a
    *dedicated* key for each layout.

[^modifiers]:
    If a modifier key is assigned to activate a layout, it continues to be a modifier key. For
    example, if the left `Ctrl`{.k} key is assigned to activate the first layout, only *tap* on the
    the left `Ctrl`{.k} activates the first layout, `Ctrl`{.k}+`C`{.k} is still interpreted as
    `^C`.

[^works]:
    Tapper works for all listed desktops, but not all listed desktops work on top of Wayland. See
    the ‚Äú[Desktops]‚Äù section.

[^void]:
    Tapper requires glibc, compilation will fail with musl C standard library.

Current version
---------------

Current version is RDF_SOFTWARE_VERSION({{ @ver@-@rel@ }}), released on RDF_DATE_PUBLISHED({{
@PACKAGE_DATE@ }}). See RDF_RELEASE_NOTES({{ [NEWS.md] }}) for list of user-visible changes.

<!--
    Skip "Getting Tapper" in case of README: if user reads README, he has already got Tapper
    source.
-->

Desktops
--------

**Important note:** Starting from version 0.6.0, Tapper requires the [Agism] GNOME Shell extension
to work for GNOME, GNOME Classic, and Ubuntu[^ubuntu] desktops.

Tapper is known to work for the following desktops (and window managers):

Desktop                X Window System        Wayland
-----------------    -------------------    -----------
[Cinnamon]             ‚úì
[GNOME]                ‚úì                      ‚úì
GNOME Classic          ‚úì                      ‚úì
[i3]                   ‚úì
[KDE]                  ‚úì                      ‚úì
[LXDE]                 ‚úì
[LXQt]                 ‚úì
[Mate]                 ‚úì
Ubuntu                 ‚úì                      ‚úì
[Xfce]                 ‚úì

Empty cell in the "Wayland" column means that Tapper has not been tested in this configuration (due
to the lack of easy-to-use distros[^easy-to-use] that runs the desktop in a Wayland session out of
the box).

If your desktop (or window manager) is not listed in the table:

*   X Window System: Tapper will likely work (if the window manager does not do weird
    things[^weird-things] with keyboard layouts).
*   Wayland: Tapper will (likely?) not work.

[^ubuntu]:
    Ubuntu OS pretends to run Ubuntu desktop: in Ubuntu graphical session, the environment variable
    `XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP` value is `ubuntu`. However, the Ubuntu desktop is actually the GNOME
    Shell with few Ubuntu-specific extensions.

[^easy-to-use]:
    *Easy-to-use distro* in this context means "there is a live CD or DVD image to run the distro
    in a virtual machine without tedious and time-consuming installation".

[^weird-things]:
    Mutter, the GNOME window manager, is an example of a window manager that does weird things, see
    section ‚Äú[Xkb layouter does not work in GNOME]‚Äù in the [tapper(1)][man.en] man page. However,
    that seems to be the only example.

Installing Tapper
-----------------

See [INSTALL.md] for build and install instructions.

Documentation
-------------

See Tapper documentation online at <@PACKAGE_URL@> or build it locally:

    $ make html

Then open `index.html` in your browser.

Tapper also recognizes `--help` command line options:

    $ tapper --help

}},{{

Installing
----------

<!-- TODO: Add a link to map/download. -->

**Important note:** Starting from version 0.6.0, Tapper requires the [Agism] GNOME Shell extension
to work for the GNOME, GNOME Classic, and Ubuntu desktops. If you install the Tapper RPM from the
`vandebugger/tapper` Copr repository as described below, [Agism] will be installed automatically,
otherwise you will have to install it yourself.

**Important note:** Regardless of how you install [Agism], **you must [enable Agism]** to let
Tapper work in GNOME, GNOME Classic, and Ubuntu desktops.

### Fedora

    $ sudo dnf copr enable vandebugger/tapper
    $ sudo dnf install tapper

### Arch

See [kbd-tapper][aur-kbd-tapper] package by [sirocco] in [AUR]. See [Arch User Repository] for
instruction how to build and install AUR packages.

### Mageia

    $ su -c "dnf copr enable vandebugger/tapper"
    $ su -c "dnf install tapper"

### OpenMandriva

Replace `$VER` with the version of your system, e. g. `cooker` or `rolling`:

    $ sudo wget -O /etc/yum/repos.d/vandebugger-tapper.repo https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/vandebugger/tapper/repo/openmandriva-$VER
    $ sudo dnf install tapper

### openSUSE

Replace `$VER` with the version of your system, e. g. `leap-15.4` or `tumbleweed`:

    $ sudo zypper addrepo https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/vandebugger/tapper/repo/opensuse-$VER/vandebugger-tapper-opensuse-$VER.repo
    $ sudo zypper install tapper

### All/Others

<!-- TODO: Add few words about it. -->

Build Tapper from [sources][tarball]. See [INSTALL.md] for build and install instructions.

<!-- TODO: Binary RPMS, old releases. -->

}})

Configuring
-----------

By default Tapper selects listener, emitter and layouter automatically, assigns the left `Ctrl`{.k}
key to activate the first layout, the right `Ctrl`{.k} key to activate the second layout, does not
ring the bell when it activates a layout.

Run tapper with `--dconf-editor` option to open *dconf Editor*[^dconf-editor] app (command
`dconf-editor`) to edit Tapper settings:

    $ tapper --dconf-editor

[^dconf-editor]:
    Probably, you will have to install it first (in case of Fedora, run
    `sudo dnf install dconf-editor`).

Alternatively, configure Tapper using command line options and arguments in combination with
`--save-settings` option. See [tapper(1)][man.en] man page for help on Tapper terms (e. g.
listener, layouter and emitter), command line options and usage examples.

Running
-------

Configure your system to run Tapper automatically each time you log in the graphical session. The
following command should work for any desktop respecting the [Desktop Application Autostart
Specification]:

    $ tapper --autostart

It can be done using the grahpical tools, but in such case the specific steps depend on your
desktop.

### GNOME

Use *Tweaks* app (command `gnome-tweaks`) to add Tapper to *Startup Applications*.

### KDE

Use *System Settings* app (command `systemsettings5`), follow to *Startup and Shutdown* to add
Tapper to *Autostart*.

## Why?

You probably know the words "ghbdtn" and "—Ä—É–¥–¥—â", which are obtained if you start typing without
making sure that the current keyboard layout corresponds to the language of the typed text. I guess
users actively typing in two (or more) languages make such mistakes many times a day[^tt].

[^tt]:
    I think number of such mistakes does not depend on touch typing. Touch typists notice mistakes
    earlier, but make such mistakes too.

A long time ago (I worked in Windows those days) I accidentally discovered: using *two different*
keys for selecting keyboard layouts (rather than *one* key for *toggling* layouts) drastically
reduces the number of "ghbdtn" mistakes.

Also I found it is very convenient to select layouts by [tapping] `Ctrl` keys (the `Left Ctrl`
[tap] selects English layout, while the `Right Ctrl` [tap] selects Russian layout) because [tap] on
a key requires less efforts and takes less time than pressing a "chord" (like `Ctrl`+`Shift` or
`Alt`+`Shift`). I have to say I used `RusLat95` keyboard layout switcher written by –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π
–ë—ã–∫–æ–≤[^ruslat95].

[^ruslat95]:
    It is a free but closed-source program. It seems it is abandoned now, but old versions still
    can be found in the net.

When I started to work in GNU/Linux, I wanted to use the same keys. There was such option in X
Window configuration files! However, using `Left Ctrl` and `Right Ctrl` as layout selectors makes
typing control characters impossible: `Left Ctrl`+`v` does not paste clipboard content any more,
but selects English layouts and types plain letter "v".

I tried to configure X Window with no success. I only achieved selecting the first layout by `Left
Ctrl`+`Left Win` and the second by `Right Ctrl`+`Menu`[^lctrl_lwin_rctrl_menu]. This was not what I
want. This was the reason for writing Tapper.

[^lctrl_lwin_rctrl_menu]:   My patch was accepted upstream.

### Toggler

A key (or key combination, e. g. `Ctrl`+`Shift` or `Win`+`Space`) which activates the *next*
keyborad layout.

In case of two layouts toggler either selects the first layout (if the second was active before) or
selects the second (if the first was active before).
